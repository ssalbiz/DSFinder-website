    This page presents the results of the DSFinder tool described in the paper
    "Implementation and Use of Data Structures in Java Programs". DSFinder is a 
    tool that uses the Java <a href="http://asm.ow2.org">ASM</a> bytecode library to investigate the occurrences of ad-hoc
    data structures within a program. The results include the raw output of the program,
    as well as our further manual analysis of the results.
  </p>
  <p>
    The DSFinder tool is distributed under the GPL, and is available for download.
    We have also released a tarball of the benchmark suite we used to generate the results.
