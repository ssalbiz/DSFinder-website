1. Basic installation
=====================

 1. tar xzvf highlight-x.x-x.tar.gz

 2. cd highlight-x.x-x

 3. make help

 4. make                 (for Linux systems)
    make all-gui         (optional, compile the wxWidgets GUI)
    make all-localgetopt (for systems without GNU getopt)

 5, make install
    (depending on your installation destination, you need to be root)

 6. make install-gui (optional)
    Install additional files if you have compiled the highlight GUI binary.
    (depending on your installation destination, you need to be root)

 7. make clean (optional)

 8. make apidocs (optional)
    (you need to have doxygen installed)

 Highlight's default data directory is /usr/share/highlight.
 You may alter this directory at compile time or at run time:
 - See the makefile how to add a compiler directive which defines an
   installation directory (data_dir variable)
 - Use the --data-dir option to define a new directory at run time. You may
   want to save this parameter in the highlight configuration file
   ($HOME/.highlightrc)
 - You can add an additional data directory by the --add-data-dir option.
   Files will be searched in this directory first. This may also be configured
   in $HOME/.highlightrc.
 - See the makefile to change the configuration file directory 
   (conf_dir variable).


 Since highlight is a tool without major dependencies, I removed the Autoconf
 installation process in release 2.0-13 to provide a smaller sized package.


2. Known compiler issues
========================

 1. Is there a stringstream / sstream header for gcc 2.95.2?

 See http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libstdc++/2000-q2/msg00700/sstream

 2. Core dumps with gcc 2.96 (RedHat 7.1, 7.3)

 RedHat included this unofficial release of gcc, which had a buggy stringstream
 implementation.
 See http://www.mail-archive.com/gcc-bugs@gcc.gnu.org/msg22146.html
 There is no workaround, please upgrade to gcc 3.x. (Reported by Mark Hessling)

 3. Compilation error with "right" IO manipulator

 In htmlcode.cpp: `right' undeclared (first use this function)
 (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it
  appears in.)
 There is no workaround, please upgrade to gcc 3.x. (Reported by Christoph Bier)


3. LaTeX unicode support
========================

To enable UTF-8 support in LaTeX, the ucs package has to be installed.
See the following package names or sources:

Fedora: tetex-unicode
SuSE:   latex-ucs

Source: http://www.unruh.de/DniQ/latex/unicode/


4. Lazy pointer issue under MacOS X
===================================

Stripping the highlight binary causes program termination at runtime:

dyld: lazy symbol binding failed: lazy pointer not found
dyld: lazy pointer not found
Trace/BPT trap

To avoid this issue, edit the makefile to not strip the binary after
linkage (clear the LDFLAGS variable).


5. Static linking (run highlight as service)
============================================

If highlight cannot be run as service because of shared linkage, link
it with the -static option (see src/makefile, LDFLAGS variable).
