to install, copy the contents of this directory to server root (/var/www/htdocs, or similar)
edit files:
  * process.sh (change the environment variables at the top of the file)
  * cgi-bin/view.cgi (change the variable $benchmark_root)

Note that the DSFinder web tool requires that the benchmark scripts be available. The BENCHMARKS_ROOT environment variable should also be set accordingly in the base benchmark script.

These files assume the sources for the benchmarks are laid out according to the same structure of the tarball.
